         In addition to a prepopulated menu of options, Select2 can\n                  dynamically create new options from text input by the user in\n                  the search box. This feature is called \"tagging\". To enable\n                  tagging, set the\n                  <code>tags</code> option to\n                  <code>true</code>:\n                </p>\n              </div>\n              <Select\n                defaultValue={selectedOption}\n                onChange={setSelectedOption}\n                options={options}\n                style={{\n                  lineHeight: '40px',\n                  color: '#7e7e7e',\n                  paddingLeft: ' 15px',\n                }}\n              />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n\n        <div className='col-xl-6'>\n          <div className='card'>\n            <div className='card-body'>\n              <div className='mb-4'>\n                <h4 className='card-title'>\n                  Tagging with multi-value select boxes\n                </h4>\n                <p>\n                  Tagging can also be used in multi-value select boxes.
